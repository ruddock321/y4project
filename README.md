# Year 4 Project

This is a project that investigates the mass loss of red giant stars in the Messier 4 globular cluster. This is done through the use of a neural network acting as a GARSTEC emulator (essentially a rapid predictor of stellar evolution), embedded within a Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM).

## Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and Machine Learning of Stellar Systems 

A repository that documents the final year project work of Kienan Ruddock and Tom Green at the University of Birmingham.

This repository is split into 3 branches:

- Master: this contains nothing
- Kienan: this contains Kienan's work. This is mostly focused on the neural network aspect of the project.
- Tom: this contains Tom's work. This is mostly focused on the HBM aspect of the project.

Note: there is some overlap between work on eachother's branches, this is because of the nature of the project. The HBM requires the neural network to function.

## Information

To view work related to the neural network navigate to -> Kienan branch -> Neural Network -> GARSTEC Emulator - GarstecModel_VX (higher number is more recent)

To view work related to the HBM navigate to -> Tom branch -> HBM stuff: this contains a mixture of work using MCMC samplers within both hierarchical and non-hierarchical Bayesian models
